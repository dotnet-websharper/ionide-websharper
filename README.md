# __ionide-websharper__
This package implements a plugin for [Atom](https://atom.io) that you can use alongside with [Ionide](http://ionide.io) to run [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) sitelets conveniently. It depends only on [ionide-fsharp](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-fsharp), which provides syntax highlighting and code assistance features for F# projects.

## Features
* Compile and run client-server WebSharper applications
* Error reporting

## Basic usage
It is really easy to get started with __ionide-websharper__, you just need to follow three main steps:

1. Open up a WebSharper project that contains a [sitelet](http://websharper.com/docs/sitelets)

    This can be an existing project created with, for example, Visual Studio or you can use [ionide-yeoman](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-yeoman/) to generate one directly in Atom.

2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and start typing "Sitelet" (without the quotes)
3. Select the command `sitelet:run` and hit `Enter`
