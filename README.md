# __ionide-websharper__
This package is part of the [Ionide](https://github.com/ionide/) plugin suite which enables [WebSharper](http://websharper.com) usage in the [Atom](https://atom.io) text editor. It depends only on [ionide-fsharp](https://github.com/ionide/ionide/ionide-fsharp) to provide error highlighting and many other IDE-like capabilities.

## Features
* Compile and run for client-server applications
* Error reporting

## Basic usage
It is really easy to get started with __ionide-websharper__, you just need to follow 3 main steps

1. Open up a WebSharper project that contains a [sitelet](http://websharper.com/docs/sitelets)

    This can be an existing project created with for example Visual Studio or you can use [ionide-yeoman](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-yeoman/) to generate one directly in Atom.
    
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` and start typing "Sitelet" (without the quotes)
3. Select the command called `sitelet:run` and hit `Enter`

Voil√°, your Sitelet started to listen on `http://localhost:9000/`.
